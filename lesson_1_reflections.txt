the bug is surely in lines which git diff indicates.

More you have control version system quicklier you can discover the bugs


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

Pros: more flexibility 
Cons: I can forget to save important commits

Pro: I don't have take care for saving the code
Cons: It doesn't follow the logic of the code and it could be not efficient


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Because in Git the files are likely related.


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

I can use git log to have the ID and I can use git diff to view the differences between two ID.


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
