When would you want to creare a remote repository rather then keeping all your work local?


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay
up-to-date with your remote repository?

So I can pull changes that I want and not all changes.



Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
 forks are the copies of other repositories that GitHub makes on the server ;
 clones are the copies of other repositories that Git makes on your computer;
 branches are different path.
