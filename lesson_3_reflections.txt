When would you want to creare a remote repository rather then keeping all your work local?

For example when I'm working with other people

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay
up-to-date with your remote repository?

So I can pull changes that I want and not all changes.



Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

 forks are the copies of other repositories that GitHub makes on the server ;
 clones are the copies of other repositories that Git makes on your computer;
 branches are different paths. 



What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally? 

it allows to work offline and to compare the latest commits with you.


How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be 
harder?

I can send emails or we can making a meeting. 


When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What 
benefits does each approach have?

If you wanted add new tools and featurs on the project but leaving master branch clean and readable for all.
